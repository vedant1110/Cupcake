  <h1>I understand… and I’ll wait</h1>
  <p>I will wait, learn and keep trying. I will not hurry your forgiveness. But I will keep being gentle; sending small notes, small surprises, small changes, until I earn the trust I lost. If you ever want to talk, I will listen without defending. If you want distance, I will give it lovingly and show you I am working.</p>
  <p class="small">If this feels heavy, I'll give you time. Click below when you're ready to reconsider.</p>
