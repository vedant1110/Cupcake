      <p>“Hey My boo-boo ❤️<br>
Main kaafi dino se un baaton ka wazan leke jee raha hoon jo maine kabhi keh hi nahi paayi. Jo kehni chahiye thi... par reh gayi. Ab har ek chhoti chhoti baat yaad aati hai — jab aap chup thi aur main samajh nahi paaya, jab aapko pyaar chahiye tha aur main zidd dikhata raha. Jab aap important thi par maine kisi aur cheez ko priority de diya.<br>
Aur ab sirf ek soonaapan hai. Aapki kami har waqt mehsoos hoti hai. Main jaanta hoon — "Sorry" keh dena easy hota hai, lekin asli maafi tab hoti hai jab insaan badalta hai. Aur main waqai badalna chahta hoon, apni galtiyon ko samajhna, aur unhe sudharna chahta hoon.<br>
Mahek, please mujhe maaf kar dijiye. Main gusse mein kabhi kabhi kuch bhi keh deta hoon, bina sochhe samjhe. Aapka dil dukhaya... aur uska guilt mere andar roz kuch todta hai. Aapke chehre ki muskaan ko ignore kiya, aapki raat ke "good night" ko taken for granted liya... aur ab samajh aata hai ki woh sab chhoti baatein kitni badi thi.<br>
Main aapki woh yaadein roz mehsoos karta hoon — woh hansi bina wajah wali, woh time jab hum kahin kho gaye the aur bas ek dusre ko dekhke haste rahe... woh bheed mein aapka haath pakadna. Lagta tha jaise duniya ruk gayi ho.<br>
Main woh pal wapas laana chahta hoon. Lekin iss baar behtar insaan banke. Aapko sunne waala, samajhne waala, feel karne waala. Agar aap mujhe ek chhota sa chance dengi... toh main har din prove karunga ki main sudhar raha hoon. Main chhoti chhoti cheezein yaad rakhunga — aapka favourite song, aapki thakan, aapka silence. Main aapko har roz yeh feel karwana chahta hoon ki you matter... a lot.<br>
Mahek, meri jaan... main akela hoon, galat tha, aur dil se maafi maangta hoon. Mujhe aapki zarurat hai — sirf pyaar ke liye nahi, balki behtar banne ke liye bhi.<br>
If tears come while you read this, let them fall — they are true. If you smile, keep that smile for me and I will spend my days trying to be the reason behind it. I will write small notes, call for no reason, learn your favourite things — because loving you is not a single act, it is the patience to keep showing up.<br>
I am sorry. I am learning. I will try. Always your stupid ideat Ved — forever trying to be better for you. 💖”</p>

I’ll show up for the little things; your sleepy voice, your fake anger, your random rants, and that smile I’d do anything to see again. I’ll send good morning texts, silly songs, small notes, and when needed, be the first to say sorry. Because loving you isn’t just a feeling, it’s something I want to do right.<br>
One soft moment at a time. One real promise at a time.<br>
Always yours. 💛<br>
Once again sorry for my mistakes</p>

The way you chew, the way you sing random songs on call when you think I’m not really listening, the way you say “ooff” when you're annoyed, and call me “gadha” with that cute fake anger.<br>
Your stubborn little corrections, the way your eyes light up when you’re proud, I love all the tiny things that make you you.<br>
I love your courage, the way you stand up for the people you care for, the softness hidden inside your strength. Those contradictions make me fall in love again and again.</p>

    <div class="message box scroll">
      <p>Because you are everything my heart didn’t know it needed — cute in the little ways that make me smile without thinking, romantic in the way you make ordinary moments feel like forever, naughty in the mischievous glances that steal my breath, dreamy like a warm sunset I never want to end, and full of fantasy so life with you feels like a story written just for us.<br>
You turn my quiet days into songs, my fears into laughter, and my empty rooms into places where love lives. When you look at me I feel seen, when you tease me I feel alive, and when you hold my hand I feel home. I love you more than words can hold — more than my chest can carry — and sometimes that love spills out as happy tears because you mean everything. 😭❤️✨🫶 You are the quiet place I come home to. You make me gentler, more patient, and softer. You make me want to be better, not for pride, but so I can deserve the warmth of your trust.<br>
If you let me, I will fill the spaces you think empty with small steady things: attention, kindness, a habit of noticing. That is my promise starting today.</p>

    <h2>Mahek — A letter from Ved</h2>
    <div class="message box scroll">
      <p>Mahek — the sun sometimes hides, but when I remember your face my world brightens in a way I cannot explain. I remember the first little things: The way we first met at Vasai station, both a little nervous, both pretending not to be. That soft smile when our eyes met… like we already knew each other somehow. We shook hands, shy but excited, and just like that, walked into a day that I still replay; the movie, the laughs, the feeling that something special had just begun...; the small fight about something silly and how we apologized to each other. Those small, honest, messy things are the threads of my favorite life.<br><br>

I am sorry for the nights I chose silence. I am sorry for when my ego made me slow to say “I was wrong.” I am sorry for the days you looked for me and found only distance. I wish I could fold those moments up and put them in my pocket. I promise to replace those pockets with open hands, with small brave apologies, with the humility to learn.<br><br>

I miss the way you say iloveyou. I miss the way your eyes narrow when you tease me. I miss the secret language of our touches, the way your hand would find mine without looking. Missing you is not a single ache — it is a million soft reminders that I keep like pictures tucked behind the ribs of my heart.<br><br>

There are memories I am greedy for: the time we almost missed the train and laughed running, your warm head on my shoulder on a rainy day, your face in the soft light of an afternoon. I want to make ten thousand of those dim, perfect afternoons with you, small rituals we invent together.<br><br>

I am not perfect. I have faults that sometimes make love messy. But I promise to turn apologies into lessons. I will learn to notice when you need me, to say sorry before the silence deepens, to choose your feelings over my pride. Teach me, correct me, slap me with kindness but don't leave me... I will accept the learning. I want to be the person who sees your small waits and answers them with leaps.<br><br>

I love your laugh. I love the way you are stubborn about little things. I love your bravery in the ways you love other people. I love that you make me a better person just by existing. Loving you is not a single moment; it’s waking up and deciding to love you again, and again, and again a thousand times a day.<br><br>

If you forgive me, I will not simply say “I love you” and leave it at that. I will fill our days with a thousand small confirmations, letters, surprise chai, warm blankets, silly texts, learning the song you hum, being present when you are sad, holding you when you are angry, and celebrating each and every moment when you are happy.<br><br>

I love you with a hunger and a tenderness both. I want to write a lifetime of slow notes on your skin with promises and small acts. You are my favorite memory and my best future. Always your ideat Ved —---> trying, learning, loving. 💖</p>

    <h2>Why I miss you</h2>
    <div class="message box scroll">
      <p>It’s like I miss you like hell, every second.<br>
Without you, my life feels incomplete.<br>
Without you, it’s like I’m missing myself.<br>
Without you…<br>
I know how I spend each second —<br>
Dragging through moments that feel endless.<br>
And the nights?<br>
They’re like hell.<br>
Sleepless, silent, and cruel.<br>
Each minute stretches like an hour<br>
Without your voice to calm the chaos.<br>
Because you’re not just someone I love —<br>
You’re the part of me that made me feel whole.<br>
Your absence echoes in every silence I sit in,<br>
In every laugh that doesn’t reach my heart,<br>
In every moment that should’ve been ours.<br>
I miss the way your presence grounded me,<br>
The comfort in your chaos,<br>
The peace in your voice.<br>
And no matter how much time passes,<br>
The ache of missing you only grows louder —<br>
Because you weren’t just in my life…<br>
You were my life.</p>

I won’t take long — in short, I just want to say I love you. Deeply. Madly. Endlessly.<br>
I know I’ve made mistakes, and I’m truly sorry for every moment that hurt you, every word left unspoken, and every silence that felt like distance. If I’m ever lucky enough to get another chance, I promise with all my heart — I’ll give you the best version of me. I’ll grow, I’ll change, and I’ll love you more and more every single day.<br>
I miss you like hell.<br>
Not a day goes by without your face in my thoughts, your voice echoing in my mind, your laughter lingering in my heart.<br>
I know I’ve been silent, but please understand — this silence is not distance, it’s the weight of missing you so deeply that words fall short.<br>
And only you can break this silence — with your love, your care, your presence.<br>
You are my peace. My chaos. My forever.<br>
No matter what you decide, I will always accept it with love and respect — because your happiness means more to me than anything.<br>
Last but never least…<br>
I love you forever, my buttercup.<br>
Always have.<br>
Always will.</p>
